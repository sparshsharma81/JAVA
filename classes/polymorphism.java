         there are two types of polymorphism
         run time and compile time 

         compile time polymorphism ---- 
         in complie time when we run the code then the compiler get to know which function is getting called...

         in compile it convert into byte code ...
         compiler knows which function to call at compile time
        there must be some declaration in function declaration

         */
        /*
         run time polymorphism---
         compiler doesn't know which function to call at compile time 
         there must be no difference in function declaration

         example--- a bolder bolwing slower without almost same booling action
         runtime polymorphism is achieved by method overriding 
         compilete time polymorphism is achieved by method overriding


         types of compile time polymorphism... 
         function declaration is different

         function signature

         method name + parameter list



         how to overload methods

         changing data types of parameters
         changing no. of parameters
         changing\\\\


         static int add(int a){
         return a} 

         static int add(int a, int b){
         return a+b;
         }

         static int add(String a,int b){
         return 10;
         }



         FUNCTION SIGNATURE----
         WE CAN NOT DO METHOD OVERLOADING BY CHANGING NAME OF FUNCTION
         IT WILL SHOW DUPLICATE METHOD....
