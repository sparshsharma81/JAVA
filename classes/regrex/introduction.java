        //regex is a powerful tool in java for defining patterns that can be used for searching
        //we can use it to find patterns and do searching in java strings
        //special way of describing patterns
        //like from 1000 paper..we need to find a code from it

        //we have a package called java.util.regex.* === where classes are there that we will use to work with regex 
        //so first we will create a pattern..then we will create a pattern and then we will search the matcher in pattern
