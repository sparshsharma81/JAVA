BRUTE FORCE APPROACH--

TO SORT A MERGED OF TWO ARRAYS--
CREATE A NEW ARRAY OF SIZE: N+M ---C;
INSERT ALL THE ELEMENTS OF A & B TO C 
SORT C-ARRAY;

TIME COMPLEXICITY -- (N+M)LOG(N+M)



OPTIMAL APPROACH--


A = [1,5,7,10];
B = [2,4,6,8];

C = [   ]

while(i<m && j<n) then do the comparision....

while(i<m) insert all element of A into C
while(j<n) insert all element of B into C.
