single test cases exist in this scenario


there are three types of constructors 
--they do not return anything
there is no return type for them

constructors are only called once

1.non parameterized constructors 

//in java we do not need to write destructors --- in java --there is garbage collector

polymorphism 
1.run time polymorphism
2.compile time polymorphism



compile time polymorphism 

different different functions with same name
 
 public void printInfo(String name){
    System.out.println(name) 
    }

    public void printInfo(int age){
        System.out.println(age);

    }
    public void printInfo(String name, int age){
        System.out.println(name + "" + age);
    }



    inheritance 
    ---ek class ki property dusri class lena chahti hai

    4 types of inheritance in java
    1.single level inheritance
    2.multi level inheritance
    3.heirarchial inheritance
    4.hybrid inheritance




    access modifiers 
    1.private
    2.protected
    3.public 
    4.default 



    encapsulation ---
    data and function ko combine karna 
    ---data hiding ---



    abstracct --- showing important things and hiding non important things 
    abstracct --- this is a blueprint --- like a concept 

    
    interface ke andar koi bhi non abstract function nahi ho sakta 

    --we implement interfaces in java
    implement is basically like inheritance ...
      if we implements a interface then all

      in interfaces ...all the filee
