Given an integer n, return the nth digit of the infinite integer sequence [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ...].

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: n = 11
Output: 0
Explanation: The 11th digit of the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ... is a 0, which is part of the number 10.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 231 - 1
